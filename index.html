                        <h3>Tyre Pressure & Temperature
                            Monitoring System</h3>
                        <p>I have built a tire pressure monitoring system specifically designed for heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses. This innovative system helps drivers by providing real-time alerts, enabling them to take necessary actions promptly. By continuously monitoring the tire health, it ensures optimal performance and safety on the road. With advanced sensors and analysis, the system detects any deviations from the recommended pressure levels. The instant alerts empower drivers to address tire-related issues immediately, reducing the risk of accidents and minimizing maintenance costs. This proactive approach promotes longer tire lifespan, enhances fuel efficiency, and contributes to overall vehicle reliability. With my tire pressure monitoring system, drivers can experience safer and more efficient journeys, backed by reliable and up-to-date tire information. Additionally, the system's user-friendly interface and easy installation process make it a convenient choice for vehicle owners. Its compatibility with various heavy vehicles ensures widespread applicability and potential for positive impact in the transportation industry.</p>

                        <h3>Woman Safety App</h3>
                        <p>
                            The woman's safety app project is a crucial initiative that focuses on addressing the safety concerns faced by women. This mobile application aims to empower women by providing them with a reliable tool to enhance their personal security. The app incorporates features tailored specifically to women's safety, including an emergency alert system that enables users to quickly send distress signals to their emergency contacts. Real-time GPS tracking allows women to share their location with trusted individuals, ensuring that their movements can be monitored for added security. The app also includes a comprehensive database of safe locations, such as police stations and women's shelters, enabling women to easily find nearby safe havens. Privacy and data security are prioritized, ensuring that user information remains confidential. Overall, the woman's safety app project strives to create a safer environment, instill confidence, and provide women with the means to navigate their daily lives with greater peace of mind. </p>

                        <h3>Automated Car</h3>
                        <p>The fully automated car project is a groundbreaking endeavor that aims to revolutionize transportation. These vehicles are designed to operate autonomously, without any human intervention, using advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, sensors, and algorithms. By integrating various sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, radar, and GPS, these cars can gather and analyze real-time data to navigate and make decisions on the road. The project prioritizes safety by reducing the risk of accidents caused by human error and aims to optimize efficiency by leveraging advanced routing algorithms and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. With the potential to minimize traffic congestion, enhance fuel efficiency, and improve overall road safety, the fully automated car project holds immense promise. However, challenges such as legal frameworks, public acceptance, and technological limitations need to be addressed for its successful implementation. Through ongoing research, collaboration, and development, this project strives to transform the way we commute, making transportation safer, more efficient, and more sustainable.</p>

                        <h3>Drone as a Delivery Man</h3>
                        <p>Problem Statement: The existing drone technology lacks advanced features that can truly enhance functionality and usability. Specifically, there is a need for drones with autonomous navigation, object detection, and aerial photography capabilities.

                            Solution: This project aims to address these demands by developing a drone with autonomous navigation using GPS and sensors, enabling it to navigate predefined routes or adapt dynamically to its surroundings. The drone will also incorporate object detection algorithms and sensors for real-time obstacle avoidance.
                            
                            Additionally, the drone will be equipped with a high-quality camera system, allowing users to capture stunning aerial photography and videos. Applications include aerial cinematography, surveying, and monitoring.
                            
                            The project involves designing and building the drone, integrating necessary hardware components, and developing software algorithms for navigation and object detection. Testing and refinement will ensure reliable and efficient drone operation.
                            
                            By creating a versatile drone with advanced features, this project will cater to various industries, including filmmaking, agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and search and rescue operations.</p>
